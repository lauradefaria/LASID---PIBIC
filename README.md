													Computational analysis of physical exercises adapted for patients with brain and spinal injuries
The objectives of this work plan include the development of a low-cost sensing device and the construction of control software. In this way, with the aid of sensors - tcrt5000 and cardiac pulse sensor - and the WiFi ESP 32 module, exercise data is obtained - instantaneous speed, time, distance covered and acceleration - in real time by an application built using Firebase platform, having their averages calculated and stored in a MongoDB, as well as the characteristics of the individual with the injury. With this, the individual's progress can be analyzed through the website, observing their performance through graphics produced with React. Finally, based on these statistics and through the cluestering technique, artificial intelligence is used to help in the next cases, comparing the characteristic similarities between the individuals and determining which is the best training style to be practiced.
